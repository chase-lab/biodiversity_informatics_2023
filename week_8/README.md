## Week 8: (Friday, June 19th): Modeling dynamics from populations to metacommunities

Instructor: Dr Zachary Hajian-Forooshani (zhajianf@gmail.com)


## Foundational models of ecological systems (10:00 - 15:00)

#### Exponential growth: Ecological justification and implementation 
      
#### Logistic growth: background, intuition, and computer exercises  
      -Exercise 1: Implementing the logistic map
      -Exercise 2: Qualitative model behavior with lambda  
      -Exercise 3: Long term behavior and sensitivity on initial conditions

#### Mechanistic population regulation and predator-prey models
      - Exercise 1: Deriving predator-prey model from exponential growth equation
      - Exercise 2: Implementing predator-prey model
      - Exercise 3: Qualitative behavior and the addition of density dependce on the prey population
