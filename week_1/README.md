## Week 1: (Monday, April 17): What is Biodiversity and how do you measure it?
Jon and Alban

### Morning session

Ice Breaker and Lab
  

1. Each student will sample ALL organisms from each local site (bags) (samples will be given at the start of the excercise). 
2. Open up the Google Spreadsheet--https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SGtdU61_3vX43Xtjaq579nEF1xuelRY3Dol2WGKFzUk/edit?usp=sharing
3. Enter data for each 'control' sample in your individual worksheet; enter data for each person in summary 'species richness' sheet
4. As a group, calculate 'total' richness of the region (all 9 local sites)
5. Experimentally impose 'predation' of 50% of individuals by an introduced predator (e.g., raccoons invading Europe). IMPORTANT: Experimental predation must be **random** (even if what you personally predate is not random)
6. Repeat Step #3 and #4, but with 'impact' data (after predation)
7. Compare species richness at 2 different spatial scales (1 local sample-->entire region) for both 'control' and 'impact'
8. Calculate log ratio effect sizes of species richness loss for each scale



Lecture

### Afternoon session

In the afternoon session, we'll introduce R, git, GitHub and basic reproducibility good practices.
